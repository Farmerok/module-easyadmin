## üöÄ **How to Use EasyAdmin in Python?**

To integrate **EasyAdmin** into your Python project, simply call it via the command line using the `subprocess` module. Follow the steps below to get started.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Preparation**

1. Download **EasyAdmin** and place it in your project folder or any location accessible from the command line. For example, you can place it in the folder `C:\Tools\EasyAdmin`.
2. Ensure the path to **EasyAdmin** is added to the `PATH` environment variable, or use the full path when calling it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Import the subprocess Module**

To execute commands from Python, use the standard `subprocess` module. This module allows you to run commands in the command line directly from a Python script.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Example**

```python
import subprocess

def run_easyadmin(command, param=""):

    Executes an EasyAdmin command via the command line.

    :param command: The command to execute (e.g., 'volumemute').
    :param param: An additional parameter for the command (e.g., 'off').
    """
    command_str = f"EasyAdmin.exe {command} {param}" if param else f"EasyAdmin.exe {command}"
    try:
        subprocess.run(command_str, shell=True, check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Command execution error: {e}")
```

#### Usage Examples:

- **Mute Sound** üîá:
  ```python
